# Optimization

This space is all about exploring optimization models and how to solve them using 
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. We’ll be using Python and the 
Pyomo library to share practical examples that help tackle complex decision-making 
problems. Please note, this is a work in progress, new models and solutions will be 
added regularly as we continue to expand and refine our content. 

Whether you're a beginner or experienced, you'll find valuable resources to enhance 
your understanding of optimization and its applications.
