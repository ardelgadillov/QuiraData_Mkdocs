    "# Traveling Salesperson Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves finding the most efficient route for a salesperson to visit a set of cities and return to the starting city, with the goal of minimizing travel distance or cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- A list of **cities** (or nodes).\n",
    "- The **distances or costs** between each pair of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "- Find the shortest possible route that visits each city **exactly once** and returns to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- Suppose there are four cities: A, B, C, and D.\n",
    "- The distances between them are:\n",
    "  - A → B: 10\n",
    "  - A → C: 15\n",
    "  - A → D: 20\n",
    "  - B → C: 35\n",
    "  - B → D: 25\n",
    "  - C → D: 30\n",

    "| B       | 10  | n/a | 35  | 25  |\n",
    "| C       | 15  | 35  | n/a | 30  |\n",

    "The task is to determine the sequence of cities (e.g., A → B → C → D → A) that minimizes the total distance traveled.\n",

    "1. **Logistics and Delivery**: Optimizing routes for delivery trucks or couriers.\n",
    "2. **Manufacturing**: Designing efficient robotic arms or conveyor belts.\n",
    "3. **Tourism**: Creating optimal travel itineraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity\n",
    "- **Computationally Hard**: TSP is NP-hard, meaning there's no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it for all cases.\n",
    "- For \\(n\\) cities, there are \\((n-1)!\\) possible routes.\n",

    "## Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** can be formulated as a **Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP)**. Below is a typical formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "- $i$, $j$: Cities (nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- $ c_{ij} $: Cost or distance of traveling from city $i$ to city $j$.\n",
    "- $ n $: Number of cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "1. **Decision Variables**:\n",
    "   - $ x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\} $: Binary variable indicating whether the path from city $i$ to city $j$ is included in the tour.\n",
    "     - $ x_{ij} = 1 $: Path from city $i$ to $j$ is used.\n",
    "     - $ x_{ij} = 0 $: Path from city $i$ to $j$ is not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Variables** (for subtour elimination):\n",
    "   - $ u_i $: A continuous variable representing the order in which city $i$ is visited, used to eliminate subtours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function:\n",
    "Minimize the total travel cost:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{x_{ij}, u_i} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{n} c_{ij} x_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "1. **Each city is entered exactly once**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=1, i \\neq j}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \\quad \\forall j = 1, \\dots, n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Each city is exited exactly once**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{n} x_{ij} = 1 \\quad \\forall i = 1, \\dots, n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subtour elimination constraints** (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation):\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   u_i - u_j + n \\cdot x_{ij} \\leq n - 1 \\quad \\forall i, j = 2, \\dots, n, \\; i \\neq j\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   1 \\leq u_i \\leq n - 1 \\quad \\forall i = 2, \\dots, n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, $u_i$ ensures that a valid sequence of cities is followed, preventing subtours. The basic formulation with decision variables $x_{ij}$ ensures each city is visited exactly once but does not inherently prevent **subtours** (i.e., tours that visit only a subset of cities). These constraints force the auxiliary variable $u_i$ to ensure a valid tour. If $x_{ij} = 1$ (i.e., there is a path from $i$ to $j$), then $u_i < u_j$.\n",
